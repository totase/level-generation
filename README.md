# ‚õ∞Ô∏è Level generation

A collection of level generators I've played around with in different projects, made for Unity.

## üìã Contents

### [Spelunky generator](https://github.com/totase/level-generation/tree/main/Assets/Scripts/Spelunky)

A simple level generator inspired by the level generation of [Spelunky](https://spelunkyworld.com/original.html). It generates a number of rooms based on a grid size, made up of x rows and y columns.

### [Drunkard's Walk](https://github.com/totase/level-generation/tree/main/Assets/Scripts/DrunkardsWalk)

A level generator using a random walk algorithm, inspired by [this algorithm](https://poppants.itch.io/the-drunkard-walk) found on itch.io. It generates rooms/corridors in random directions based on the input size.

### Unity version

Project was made with Unity version 2022.3.22f1
