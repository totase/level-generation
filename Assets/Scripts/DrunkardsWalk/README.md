# ðŸš¶ Drunkard's Walk

A level generator using a random walk algorithm, inspired by [this algorithm](https://poppants.itch.io/the-drunkard-walk) found on itch.io. It generates rooms/corridors in random directions based on the input size.

## How it works

Starting from a given point, the algorithm takes a walk in a random direction and marks each position in `_walkLength` as part of the path. This process is repeated `_numWalks` times.

The starting point is set to 0 on both `x` and `y`, but a random starting point within a given board can easily be implemented.

## Demo

In the demo below, `_numWalks` is set to 4 and `_walkLength` is set to 12.
